## Description: 

This was to fulfill the Module 2 assignment where I was to make a portfolio page. The acceptance criteria for the webpage is below and serves as a summary of what went into the page.

### Acceptance Criteria
"Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs: GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

- WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
