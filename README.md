## Description: 

Dropping assignment here:

### User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

### Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

DONE-------------------
- WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

DONE--------------------
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

DONE--------------------
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

MAYBE DONE--------------
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others


- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
