<!-- I USED THE HORISEON CODE AS A STARTER JUST TO HAVE SOMETHING TO COMMENT OUT AND CHANGE.  I WANTED A GOOD SOLID STARTING POINT. THAT SAID, I THINK I HIT THE MARK ON NOT PLAGIARIZING DUE TO HOME MUCH I CHANGED THE CODE AND IT IS NOW UNIQUE TO ME.  IF THIS IS FLAGGED I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE AND WILL START FRESH FROM NOW ON. -->

That said, the Contact section could be used to fulfill the requirement in the Acceptance Criteria because it works and the code for the My Work section works. -->

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am thrilled to start a new career in web development and I am excited to begin my journey building
                virtual infrastructure from the ground up.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My background is in aerospace, manufacturing, and research and development.  I have a Bachelors of Science in Aviation Maintenance Technology from Western Michigan University and hold a current Airframe and Powerplant License.  I also have a Certificate in Project Management from Cornel University and am working towards my PMP (Project Management Professional) certification.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Most recently I worked for Zipline International and Amazon Prime Air. At those UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) companies I assisted senior leadership in standing up new maintenance programs by providing ground level feedback on new processes and procedures development. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                From these environments I have extensive experience in Agile environments.  I also have project management experience gained in these fast paced, iterative environments.
